Wire-Cell and Bee have logos!

{{{TEASER_END}}}

For a while, the "branding" for Wire-Cell on this blog and on GitHub
has been in the form of an image of ionization activity reconstructed
using Wire-Cell imaging and displayed in the [[https://www.phy.bnl.gov/wire-cell/bee/][Bee]] event visualization
system:

Xin Qian recently came up with an initial concept for a new and proper
logo and Chao Zhang tuned it up including a variant for his [[https://www.phy.bnl.gov/wire-cell/bee/][Bee]] event
visualization system.  The main Wire-Cell logo is now:

[[img-url:/images/wire-cell-logo.png]]

As can be noticed by frequent visitors to this blog, it has already
replaced the old screen shot branding.  A version with a transparent
background is also produced:

The logo specialized for Bee is:

[[img-url:/images/wire-cell-bee-logo.png]]

We lack vector PDF and SVG versions of these which are needed for
producing quality presentations and papers.  If anyone has the skills
to produce these forms, please do so and contribute them!
