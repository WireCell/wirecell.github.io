[[Jsonnet]] is now a required external dependency.  It is just far too
useful to keep optional and it's a very light-weight package so easy
to build.  However, it is not yet added to ~wire-cell-spack~ (see
[[https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-spack/issues/1][inaugural issue]]).  Building it yourself is simple but non-standard.
Follow this guide:

1) Get the source and do ~make all~
2) Copy the two header under ~include/~ at some installation path.
3) Similarly,   copy the two shared libraries to ~lib/~ at some installation path.
4) Finally, copy the executable binary ~jsonnet~ to some ~bin/~.

One annoyance with the elaborate configuration which Jsonnet makes
easy is that, for some things, you do not want to constantly edit a
file just to make some small change.  In particular, initial input and
final output files are often best given directly on the command line
rather than in some configuration file.  Jsonnet also comes to the
rescue here by allowing external parameters to be "injected" into the
configuration using its ~std.extVar("name")~ function.  

For this to work, the author of some configuration calls this function
where they would otherwise type in the value.  Then the user must
supply that value on the ~wire-cell~ command line or if compiling the
Jsonnet to JSON via the ~jsonnet~ CLI.  

An example is in the configuration supporting the new "multi-ductor"
feature (stay tuned for details).  One spot it is used can be found in
[[https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-cfg/blob/master/multi/depos.jsonnet][depos.jsonnet]] where the input file holding depositions is set.  The
user of ~wire-cell~ or ~jsonnet~ sets a value for this variable in the
same way: by simply adding a ~-V~ flag.  Here is a full example with
some comments to explain:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ wire-cell \
     -V detector=uboone \                         # (1)
     -V depofile=g4tuple-qsn-v1-fixed.json.bz2 \  # (2)
     -V framefile=uboone.root \                   # (3)
     -c multi/init.jsonnet \                      # (4) 
     -c multi/multiductor.jsonnet                 # (5)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Notes:
1) A variable =detector= is used in various places of the configuration to switch between some global parameters specific to that detector.
2) The input =depofile= is set.  Remember that WCT will look for JSON/Jonnet files in directories given in the =WIRECELL_PATH= environment variable.  
3) The output =framefile= is set.  This will hold all the frames of traces (aka the "event") that get simulated.
4) The first of two configuration files that being the list of configurables.
5) The "meat" of the configuration.
