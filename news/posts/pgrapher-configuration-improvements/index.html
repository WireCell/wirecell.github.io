A powerful new idiom has been developed to simplify developing Jsonnet
configuration files for Wire-Cell toolkit's Pgrapher app component.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
The <a href="../pgrapher-execution-engine/">previous post</a> described the Pgrapher execution engine.  It
included a short configuration snippet.  Astute readers that studied
that example may conclude that the power and flexibility of Pgrapher
may come at a cost of writing a lot of configuration code.  
</p>

<p>
In part, they'd be right.  It is actually fairly straight-forward to
configure a simple job and especially if one has in mind a single
target.  However, the power of Jsonnet and the flexibility of Pgrapher
essentially begs one to construct modular "chunks" of configuration
that can be reused to build up to a variety of final targets.  This
means the configuration author needs a way to encapsulate incomplete
(sub) graphs, aggregate these into larger graphs, etc, until a fully
complete graph can be built from the smaller parts.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Graphs of Nodes and Nodes of Graphs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
To jump the the punch line, the idiom that has been developed is to
allow for an incomplete (sub) graph to be recast into a single "node"
which may then be used in a larger graph.  This recasting may continue
as one builds up the graph until one is left with a single node which
"wraps" the entire graph.  With this abstraction the author may focus
on one area of the graph, for example the simulation and parts
therein.  The results may then be exposed as a few high-level nodes
which hide details of the sub graph they represent.  
</p>

<p>
What follows are details on how to use this new idiom.  It starts with
some review of how to configure a Pgrapher "manually" and then goes
into the new methods.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Pgrapher Graph</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
As hinted in the previous post, a Pgrapher graph is ultimately built
up of <i>edges</i> which connect <i>nodes</i> via their <i>ports</i>.  For example
one edge can be written as:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>{
    tail: { node: wc.tn(fanout), port: 0 },
    head: { node: wc.tn(sink1) },
},
{
    tail: { node: wc.tn(fanout), port: 1 },
    head: { node: wc.tn(sink2) },
},
</pre></div>

<p>
Here, <code>fanout</code>, <code>sink1</code>, etc, are configuration objects.  They are
what make up the final <i>configuration sequence</i> that the main Jsonnet
file must produce.  Their contents follow an object schema as
described in <a href="https://wirecell.github.io/manual.html#configuration">the WCT manual</a>.  The <code>wc.tn()</code> Jsonnet function (provided
by <a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-cfg/blob/master/wirecell.jsonnet">wirecell.jsonnet</a>) processes an object and returns its canonical
label.  Not all configuration objects correspond to WCT <code>INode</code> but
the ones used in a graph must.  As is also shown, a node may have
multiple input or output ports and edges that do not connect to port 0
must have an explicit <code>port</code> attribute set.
</p>

<p>
As is, this is all that one needs to know to build up Pgrapher graphs.
Now consider if you want to take these two edges and use them to build
a variety of different graphs.  Besides arranging to get this snipped
used in whatever Jsonnet files you must also keep track of <code>fanout</code>,
<code>sink1</code>, etc objects and make sure they get placed into the final
<i>configuration sequence</i>.  The user of your bit of configuration may
also want to <b>break</b> one of your edges so that they can insert some
other nodes between, say, <code>fanout</code> and <code>sink1</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Pnodes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
To provide more flexibility a Jsonnet library <a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-cfg/blob/master/pgraph.jsonnet">pgraph.jsonnet</a> has been
developed.  It hinges on the concept of a <code>pnode</code>.  A <code>pnode</code> is an
abstract node which represents ("wraps") either a single <code>INode</code>
configuration object described above or a number of other <code>pnode</code>
objects.  
</p>

<p>
Regardless of what is "inside" a <code>pnode</code> it still looks and acts like
a single node.  It may contain an arbitrarily complex (sub) graph but
all the user must care about is what input and output ports it
presents.  Thus they present the same level of complexity (simplicity)
as an individual <code>INode</code> even if they may have very complex internal
representations.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, a <code>pnode</code> need not be treated as a complete "black
box".  One thing it holds is a list of internal edges and it is
possible to derive a new <code>pnode</code> whereby the user breaks an edge in
order to insert new edges and nodes.
</p>

<p>
Besides managing internal edges, a <code>pnode</code> also manages the other
nodes which it "uses".  Configuration authors to list object
dependencies for their <code>pnode</code> and as nodes are combined their "uses"
track what is needed.  When the graph is finally built, the "uses"
array makes up the <i>configuration sequence</i> relevant to the graph and
the "edges" list is what is given to the Pgrapher app.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Produce a <code>pnode</code> from an <code>INode</code> configuration object</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
It all starts with wrapping a single <code>INode</code> configuration object.
This is done through a function:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>local wc = import "wirecell.jsonnet";
local g = import "pgraph.jsonnet";               // [1]
local other = import "some_other_file.jsonnet";  // [2]

// a temporary variable holding the basic INode configuration object
local my_inode = {                               // [3]
    type: "MyNode",
    data: { 
	my_tool: wc.tn(other.cool_tool),         // [4]
    },
};

// a temporary holding the pnode wrapper            [5]
local my_pnode = g.pnode(my_inode, uses: [other.cool_tool], nin=1, nout=1);

// finally what we export to the importer of this file
{
    a_truly_great_node: my_pnode,                // [6]
}
</pre></div>

<p>
What's going on?
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Import the <code>pgraph</code> Jsonnet library
</li>
<li>Import your friends configuration library providing some cools tool.
</li>
<li>Create a temporary variable holding the configuration for your node
</li>
<li>Tell your node configuration the instance label for the cool tool (ultimately, this is used to look up the C++ tool by your C++ node implementation).
</li>
<li>Wrap your <code>inode</code> configuration into a <code>pnode</code>.  The <code>uses</code> argument tells the <code>pnode</code> what other objects your node depends on and the <code>nin</code> and <code>nout</code> give the input/output port multiplicity.
</li>
<li>Finally we export the <code>pnode</code> in an object so that it may be used by yet higher-level configuration code.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note, Jsonnet syntax doesn't require local node variables.  The above could be shortened to just:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>local wc = import "wirecell.jsonnet";
local g = import "pgraph.jsonnet";
local other = import "some_other_file.jsonnet";

{
    a_truly_great_node: g.pnode({
	type: "MyNode",
	data: { 
	    my_tool: wc.tn(other.cool_tool),
	},
    }, uses: [other.cool_tool], nin=1, nout=1);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2">Intern Pnodes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
So far, this is just more work.  Where the payoff begins is the
ability to pack up connected <code>pnodes</code> into an encompassing <code>pnode</code>.
For example:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>{
    n1: g.pnode({type:"Node", name:"n1"}, nout=1),
    n2: g.pnode({type:"Node", name:"n2"}, nin=1, nout=1),
    n3: g.pnode({type:"Node", name:"n3"}, nin=1),
    pn: g.intern([$.n1],[$.n3],[$.n2],[
	g.edge($.n1, $.n2),
	g.edge($.n2, $.n3)], "pn"),
</pre></div>

<p>
Here, <code>n1</code> is a source, <code>n2</code> is a filter (one input port, out output
port) and <code>n3</code> is a sink.
</p>

<p>
The <code>pgraph.intern()</code> function takes three lists of nodes (input,
output and internal) which may be empty, and list of <i>internal edges</i>
that connect those nodes.  In this example <code>n1</code> is an input, <code>n3</code> is
an output and <code>n2</code> is internal and connected to the other two.  The
resulting <code>pn</code> is still but a single node but it represents an entire
graph (complete in this case).  Continuing with this example:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>    n12: g.intern([$.n1],[$.n2],edges=[
	g.edge($.n1, $.n2)
    ], name="n12"),
    n123: g.intern([$.n12],[$.n3],edges=[
	g.edge($.n12, $.n3),
    ], name="n123"),
}
</pre></div>

<p>
Here <code>n12</code> is a <code>pnode</code> which represents an <b>incomplete</b> graph.  It
has edges that join <code>n1</code> to <code>n2</code> while <code>n2</code>'s output port becomes the
output port of <code>n12</code>.  Another user may form <code>n123</code> by yet another
interning to produce a <code>pnode</code> holding again a complete graph.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3">Edge breaking and node insertion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
As mentioned above, given knowledge of the order of edges <b>inside</b> a
<code>pnode</code> it is possible to derive a new <code>pnode</code> which breaks an edge in
order to insert new <code>pnodes</code>.  Extending the above example further:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>n13: g.intern([$.n1],[$.n3], edges=[
    g.edge($.n1, $.n3),
], name="n13"),

n123inserted: g.insert_one($.n13, 0, $.n2, $.n2, name="n123inserted"),
</pre></div>

<p>
The <code>n13</code> node has interned <code>n1</code> and <code>n3</code> which are connected in a
kind of "short circuit".  Now, some other user may want to do
something with the data that flows between this source and sink.
Knowing that the <code>(n1,n3)</code> edge is at index 0 in the list of <code>n13</code>
edges it is possible to break that edge and insert a new node (<code>n2</code>)
which is done when setting <code>n123inserted</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-4">A fancy example</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
The above example uses a graph which is really a simple linear
pipeline.  Real graphs may be much more complex.  For example, in the
case of simulating signal and noise both represent their own stream of
data frames.  The two stream must be summed together.  A <code>pnode</code> can
be built which makes it easy to build to configuration variants, one
with just signal and one with also noise.  Without defining
everything, the noise portion is defined as:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>local noise_source = g.pnode({
    type: "NoiseSource",
    data: { ... },
}, nout=1);
local frame_summer = g.pnode({
    type: "FrameSummer",
    data: { ... },
}, nin=2, nout=1);

{
    nominal: g.intern([frame_summer],[frame_summer],[noise_source],
		      iports=frame_summer.iports[:1],
		      oports=frame_summer.oports,
		      edges=[g.edge(noise_source, frame_summer, 0, 1)],
		      name="NominalNoise"),
}
</pre></div>

<p>
The produced <code>nominal</code> <code>pnode</code> object now has simply one input port
and one output port, both which are actually provided by the "frame
summer" node.  The "noise source" node gets carried along properly.
By default the resulting <code>pnode</code> input ports consist of all input
ports of all input nodes and etc for output.  But here, one input port
of the frame summer is already connected to the noise source.  To
indicate this special arrangement the <code>iports</code> and <code>oports</code> arguments
are passed.  These explicitly give the port descriptors to use for the
resulting <code>pnode</code>.
</p>

<p>
This may seem confusing but once worked out, the user of the resulting
<code>pnode</code> need not care.  The complexity is hidden.  The user just needs
to take this <code>nominal</code> node and connect it to others.  
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Going further</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
To learn more about this new
configuration idiom you may wish to run the example (excerpted above):
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ jsonnet -J cfg  cfg/test/test_pgraph.jsonnet
</pre>

<p>
A working configuration is being developed in <a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-cfg/blob/master/uboone/simsp/">cfg/uboone/simsp/</a>.  
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ wire-cell -c cfg/uboone/simsp/main-simple-quiet.jsonnet
</pre>

<p>
That top-level configuration file shows the end-game.  It builds a
complete graph of <code>pnodes</code> and uses it to configure the Pgrapher app
and to provide the final <i>configuration sequence</i>.  
In summary:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>local g = import "pgraph.jsonnet";
// ...

local graph = g.intern(...);
local app = {
    type: "Pgrapher",
    data: {
	edges: g.edges(graph),
    }
};

// final configuration sequence.
[com.cmdline] + g.uses(graph) + [app]
</pre></div>

<p>
Note that both the <code>graph.edges</code> and <code>graph.uses</code> list attributes will
likely have duplicate entries due to details in how they are
constructed.  In order to properly strip them of duplicates while
retaining proper order (in the case of <code>.uses</code>) they must be extracted
through <code>pgraph</code> functions of the same name.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Summary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
This turned into a long post.  Eventually, I hope it will be distilled
and integrated into the manual.  It shows what you need to know to get
started authoring or extending a configuration for WCT jobs based on
the Pgrapher app.  Of course this <code>pnode</code> idiom need not be followed
in your own configuration of WCT.  However WCT is now reaching a point
where the wide variety of features it provides, still fewer than it
eventually will, requires something to manage complexity of
configuration.  Thankfully, Jsonnet provides such a good basis for a
configuration language that idioms like <code>pnode</code> can be invented.  This
idiom will be further explored as a configuration is developed to
handle the current breath of WCT.  It is targeting these features and
options:
