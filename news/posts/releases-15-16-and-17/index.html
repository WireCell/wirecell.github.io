Releases 0.15, 0.16 and 0.17 (in prep) come with some changes worth
mentioning.  So, here we mention them.  At length….
</p>

<p>
Some changes are "breaking" and others provide new, better ways to do
things.  Many are cleanups which were needed for a while.  As 0.17 is
not technically cut, it may have additional changes.  So, sit back and
read about some of the improvements that you may not yet have learned
about.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<div id="outline-container-org4efdec7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4efdec7">Release 0.15</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4efdec7">
<p>
We start with 0.15 made June 2021.  This release was actually
motivated by upgrades to Boost and TBB that Fermilab wanted to apply
to <i>art</i> and LArSoft but it also collected a lot of prior development
after 0.14 from May 2020.
</p>

<p>
Starting then and due to backwards incompatible changes in TBB, WCT
now begins to track minimum versions on some requirements:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>TBB (oneAPI) 2021.1.1</li>
<li>Boost 1.75.0</li>
</ul>
<p>
As these may change we will strive to keep the <a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit#external-software-dependencies">list in the main README</a>
up to date.
</p>

<p>
This release also brought
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Support for Jsonnet "top level arguments" (TLA) which we now
recommend to "inject" external information instead of the previously
used <code>std.extVar()</code> idiom.</li>
<li>Support for the ICARUS and SBND detectors.</li>
<li>Increased flow graph fanout sizes.</li>
<li>JSON and Numpy I/O for depos and frames.</li>
<li>Many other smaller features and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9f6bf05" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9f6bf05">Release 0.16</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9f6bf05">
<p>
This release is largely a cleanup, made 17 Aug 2021.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Signal-ROI refinement finding may be excluded from sigproc (backported to 0.14.1).</li>
<li>Switch from Jsonnet's C++ API to the C API and the Go implementation.</li>
<li>Fix out-of-order problems with <code>TbbFlow</code>.</li>
<li>Add support for streaming I/O via <code>boost::iostreams</code> and a new <code>tar</code> based stream filter.</li>
</ul>
<p>
More details on these follow.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org02b7523" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org02b7523">Go Jsonnet</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org02b7523">
<p>
The C Jsonnet library (<code>libjsonnet.so</code>) is essentially unoptimized.  It
is easy to create WCT configuration that can take many seconds, even
minutes to parse.  On the other hand, the Go version (<code>libgojsonnet.so</code>)
is well optimized.  What may take minutes for the C version to consume
takes a few hundred milliseconds for the Go version.
</p>

<p>
The Go library is not ABI compatible but thankfully it is API
compatible.  In principle the C++ API could be used to access either
the C/C++ version or the Go/C++ version.  However, problems were
uncounted and it was simpler to drop WCT down to the C API.
</p>

<p>
At this point, while the Go version is not required, it is <b>strongly
recommended</b>.  In particular, the WCT team will not work on any
configuration speed issues that are not reproduced with the Go
version.
</p>

<p>
Like the C version, the Go version build is not totally polished and
Go is not a common compiler in our ecosystem so here are some brief
instructions to build.  It assumes the install target is <code>/usr/local</code>
(such as in this <a href="https://github.com/LS4GAN/containers/blob/master/docker/wirecell/Dockerfile#L35">Dockerfile</a>) so adjust to fit your own desired install
prefix.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org7d437b7">
$ exportg JSONNET_VERSION=0.17.0
wget -O /usr/include/libjsonnet.h \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/jsonnet/v${JSONNET_VERSION}/include/libjsonnet.h
git clone https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet.git
cd go-jsonnet
git checkout v${JSONNET_VERSION}
go build ./cmd/jsonnet
go build ./cmd/jsonnetfmt
go build ./cmd/jsonnet-deps
CGO_CXXFLAGS="-std=c++17 -Wall -I/usr/local/include" \
  go build -o libgojsonnet.so -buildmode=c-shared ./c-bindings
cp libgojsonnet.h /usr/local/include/
cp libgojsonnet.so /usr/local/lib/
cp jsonnet jsonnetfmt jsonnet-deps /usr/local/bin/
</pre>

<p>
WCT build has added support to use the Go version of the library:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org789b9fd">
$ ./wcb configure \
  --with-jsonnet=/usr/local \
  --with-jsonnet-libs=gojsonnet \

<div id="outline-container-org7796b2b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7796b2b">TbbFlow out-of-order</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7796b2b">
<p>
We got something of a surprise to start seeing out-of-order data on
<code>TbbFlow</code> flow graph edges.  This ended up being due to several issues
related to confusion over details of how TBB's <code>flow_graph</code> works with
respect to concurrency and buffering.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We had many nodes configured to use unlimited concurrency and which
should not have been.</li>
<li>The TBB <code>split_node</code> that underpins every "fanout" node has unlimited
concurrency.  This can not be changed but more importantly it was
not realized to be the case.</li>
<li>Despite the TBB documentation, the input buffering of <code>function_node</code>
is not a FIFO and is an undocumented source of out-of-order (which
apparently others have already stumbled upon).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The solutions include making concurrency of all nodes, where possible,
be "serial".  We may come back to this at some point to allow more
concurrency but so far we can do the simple thing and still fill out
more threads than typically are available.
</p>

<p>
To solve the not-a-FIFO buffer problem, <code>TbbFlow</code> will now append
<code>sequencer_node</code> to existing nodes.  To give this fodder, a sequence
number is now combined with the normal data payload that is passed on
<code>TbbFlow</code> edges.  All of this happens in <code>TbbFlow</code> and developers of
individual <code>INode</code> components need not change anything.
</p>

<p>
After figuring out the problem, one mystery was why this had not come
to bite us earlier.  The reasons are likely some mix of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Though we have tested <code>TbbFlow</code> in the past, its use is increasing as
we attempt ever larger jobs and higher thread usage.  These jobs are
reaching new regions of "configuration phase space" and that gets us
to:</li>

<li>The out-of-order problem will not happen, or at least is very rare,
unless we, in a sense, "over provisions" TBB with "too many"
threads.  Eg, a ProtoDUNE-SP job usually has 6 pipelines providing
the main bottleneck.  Providing 8 threads allows out-of-order while
fewer threads do not.  Parts of these jobs will have otherwise idle
threads.</li>

<li>Fast multi-object output from a component also seems to be
correlated with the out-of-order problem.  This happens with short
one "event" jobs which then cause a component to emit an output very
quickly followed with an EOS.  This increases the chance that the
buffer in a succeeding node will gain two objects and thus have a
chance to pick the "later" one instead of the desired "earlier" one.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In any case, these problems seem now to be solved and one can safely
use multi-threading.  Understanding and fixing this began in 0.16 but
is complete in 0.17.  So, best not use 0.16 if <code>TbbFlow</code> is needed.
<code>Pgrapher</code> is of course totally unaffected.  (But has other performance
issues fixed in 0.17).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org82ed6ea" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org82ed6ea">Streaming IO</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org82ed6ea">
<p>
WCT already used <code>boost::iostreams</code> to read our somewhat large <code>.json.bz2</code>
configuration "data" files.  This release adds powerful
<code>boost::iostreams</code> filters that lets the <code>tar</code> codec be used.  It also
adds a new Numpy (<code>.npy</code> file) codec (the existing <code>cnpy</code> is still
available).  Both of these new codecs are implemented from scratch as
C++ header-only libraries part of the <a href="https://github.com/brettviren/custard">custard</a> project.
</p>

<p>
Together, they solve some problems related to saving data beyond the
various maximum sizes imposed by <code>cnpy</code> (and really by its ZIP format).
They also give a powerful way to read and write any stream which is
composed of individual files.  Components have been developed to make
use of this streaming including I/O for depos, frames and clusters.
See the <code>*File{Sink,Source}</code> components in <a href="https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-toolkit/tree/master/sio/src">sio</a>.  Work on these extend
into 0.17.
</p>

<p>
Not considered part of the WCT release cycle, but <code>wire-cell-python</code>
also sees updates to make transparent use of <code>.npy</code>-in-<code>.tar</code> files
(compressed or not) in symmetry with standard <code>.npz</code> Numpy files.

<div id="outline-container-orga1a3204" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga1a3204">Release 0.17</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga1a3204">
<p>
Hot on the tail of 0.16, we are soon making 0.17.  It is not yet
officially cut but we will ignore that minor detail and describe many
useful things it brings.  Besides finishing out-of-order fixes and
streaming I/O components mentioned above this release brings:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A version string!</li>
<li>Logging improvements.</li>
<li>Removal of vestigial <code>python/</code> sub-directory.</li>
<li>A "batched" <code>DepoSetDrifter</code> and loader.</li>
<li>Graph execution tracing in <code>TbbFlow</code>.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org60323f0" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org60323f0">Version string</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org60323f0">
<p>
A long missing feature of WCT is to know what version it is.  A
version string is now provided which is based on the state of the git
repository from which WCT was built.  It will not be well defined if
building from a directory outside of git's control.  When built from
source managed by git the output of:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga513017">
git describe --tags
</pre>

<p>
gets baked in to <code>libWireCellUtil.so</code> (see top of <code>wscript</code>).  This
version string can be recovered on the command line:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org696948c">
$ wire-cell --version
0.16.0-19-gfa04dd3
</pre>

<p>
Applications using WCT, may get the version string from the same place
that <code>wire-cell</code> CLI does:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">WireCell</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Main</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"></span>

<div id="outline-container-org04a0f2b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org04a0f2b">Logging improvements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org04a0f2b">
<p>
In the course of debugging the out-of-order problem described above,
logging was shown to be very inadequate.  Two major problems existed:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Variability in log line format made it difficult to understand
bigger picture.</li>
<li>Lack of individual node identity was a source of degeneracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Given the concurrent nature of the data flow graph execution with
<code>TbbFlow</code> and the out-of-order problem being worked on these problems
added up to a real mess!  it was a mess!
</p>

<p>
To fix this, the following changes were made:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A new <code>INamed</code> interface was introduced as a way to tell components
their instance names.</li>
<li>A new <code>Aux::Logger</code> intermediate class provides <code>INamed</code> as well as a
log object which formats messages consistently with type and
instance names.</li>
<li>Additions to low level <code>spdlog</code> handling related to making distinct
sinks in order to support different format patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To add benefit, all components need the following modifications:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Add <code>Aux::Logger</code> to the component inheritance.  Call the new parent
class constructor as illustrated:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">MyComponent</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Aux</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Logger</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{};</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="n">MyComponent</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">MyComponent</span><span class="p">(...)</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">// shows as "[  mygrp  ] &lt;MyComponent:instancename&gt; ..."</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Aux</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">Logger</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"MyComponent"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">"mygrp"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</pre></div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Replace any locally constructed log objects to the one provided by
the new parent as the protected data member named <code>log</code>.</li>

<li>Remove from the log message itself any identifiers related to type
or instance.  They will simply become cluster and are now redundant
with a standard prefix given to each log line by the <code>Aux::Logger</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
At the same time, we also now try to format information in the log
line body in a more consistent manner using phrases of "key=value"
like:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org5c68fa2">
log-&gt;debug("call={} value={}", m_count, m_myval);
</pre>

<p>
This make it much easier to <code>grep</code> logs for values.  The result allows
for rational log queries to pull out portions of the graph.
</p>

<p>
And, finally, it is especially helpful to revisit configuration to
rationalize the component instance names.  It is recommended that were
possible give an instance name which is simply the number associated
with the pipeline branch (usually the APA ID number).  In some cases
this would produce type+instance pairs that are degenerate and
something more must be provided in the instance name.  One such case
is when multiple <code>FrameFileSink</code> components are on the same pipeline and
for these it is suggested to use an instance name matching the frame
"tag" name (eg, "orig1", "gauss5").
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of finding logs related to APA 0's pipeline
executing sim, sigproc and 3D imaging.

Nice and tidy and effectively impossible to do before unless one made
an exhaustively long <code>grep</code> command line.

<p>
This example is from a single "event" job.  Note the lack of
out-of-order EOS's for any given component!

For a while now we have deprecated the use of the <code>python/</code> sub
directory in the <code>wire-cell-toolkit</code> repository and instead want all
updates committed to <code>wire-cell-python</code>.  Well, <b>some people</b> (me) kept
forgetting and would commit to <code>python/</code> and that lead to divergence
which was somewhat irritating to fix.  To remove this pitfall, the two
underwent a final sync (via <code>git-subrepo</code>) and the deprecated location
has been removed.  If you still used <code>python/</code> and see it disappeared,
hopefully this paragraph gives you closure.

The <code>Pgrapher</code> data flow execution engine is very simple (it must be for
I came up with it).  It works by first performing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>
on the flow graph.  Each execution cycle, <code>Pgrapher</code> will then iterate
the sorted graph in reverse order.  The engine starts with
the last output node and if the node has input waiting the node will
be executed.  If no input is waiting, the engine goes "upstream" one
more node and repeats until it finds a ready node.  Once a node is
executed the iteration restarts again at the last output node.
</p>

<p>
This simple algorithm is designed to move data through the graph in a
compact "wave", thus minimizing the amount of data "in flight" in the
hopes of keeping memory usage low.  For this goal, it is successful as
WCT tends to contribute less than or around 1GB to 6-APA jobs.
</p>

<p>
And, this algorithm works fast for small graphs and even large graphs
if the number of data objects is small.  However, it meets a pathology
when individual depos are passed through the graph.  Made worse, the
depos tend to be at the input end of the graph causing each depo
transfer to require an almost entire graph iteration.  <code>Pgrapher</code> will
then uselessly iterate almost the entire graph O(1M) times per
"event"!
</p>

<p>
As a consequence, a job can take many <b>minutes per event</b> just to
shuttle around these individual depos.  Given that the rest of the
simulation stage requires less than one minute for an APA, all this
time to do very little is intolerable.
</p>

<p>
This pathology requires a combination of <code>Pgrapher</code> and many individual
data objects, especially ones at the start of the graph.  Fix either
and the pathology is broken.  We can switch to <code>TbbFlow</code> and keep our
individual depos, or we can stick with <code>Pgrapher</code> but transfer depos all
together.
</p>

<p>
To keep <code>Pgrapher</code> viable, a <code>DepoSetDrifter</code> is created.  It takes in an
entire set of depos, drifts them, and outputs the result as another
depo set.  This new component still uses the exact same <code>Drifter</code> as a
local (out-of-graph) helper component to do the actual drifting
one-by-one.  <code>Drifter</code> itself is plenty fast (though certainly could
become faster with SIMD) and all this new depo set drifter does is
avoid the <code>Pgrapher</code> pathology.
</p>

<p>
Of course you ask, why not both?  While <code>TbbFlow</code> is very fast with
singular <code>Drifter</code> it can be made even faster using the new
<code>DepoSetDrifter</code>.
</p>

<p>
Here are some timing numbers from the four combinations made by the
outer product of:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgabf4a6c">
(Pgrapher, TbbFlow) x (singular depos, depo set)
</pre>

<pre class="example" id="org52787d6">
TbbFlow, 1 thread, depo set: 0.746s
[11:05:22.321] D [   io   ] &lt;NumpyDepoSetLoader:depos&gt; call=0 sent ndepos=627983

TbbFlow, 1 thread, singular depo: 1.423s
[11:07:11.140] D [   io   ] &lt;NumpyDepoLoader:depos&gt; load 0 complete with 627983 new, 627983 total
[11:07:12.563] D [  glue  ] &lt;DepoSetFanout:fanout&gt; call=0 fanout depo set 0 with 164164

Pgrapher, 1 thread, depo set: 0.756s
[11:08:29.559] D [   io   ] &lt;NumpyDepoSetLoader:depos&gt; call=0 sent ndepos=627983
[11:08:30.315] D [  glue  ] &lt;DepoSetFanout:fanout&gt; call=0 fanout depo set 0 with 537049

Pgrapher, 1 thread, singular depo: 221s
[11:09:03.242] D [   io   ] &lt;NumpyDepoLoader:depos&gt; load 0 complete with 627983 new, 627983 total
[11:12:33.302] D [  gen   ] &lt;Drifter:&gt; see EOS, ( dropped:90934 + drifted:537049 ) / total:627983 depos from stream, outside of all 4 drift xregions
[11:12:43.911] D [  glue  ] &lt;DepoSetFanout:fanout&gt; call=0 fanout depo set 0 with 164164
</pre>

<p>
So, we are now able to choose <code>TbbFlow</code> or <code>Pgrapher</code> based on other
requirements while in both cases the new <code>DepoSetDrifter</code> is preferable.
The singular <code>Drifter</code> may still be used (with <code>TbbFlow</code>, even if with
only one thread) in cases where there is not yet a source that
provides depos batched into sets.

<code>Pgraher</code> has a very useful feature of measuring the time spent by each
component and dumping out a summary at the end of the job showing
which nodes are the CPU pigs.  <code>TbbFlow</code> has lacked any such measure
and that is now (partly) corrected.
</p>

<p>
<code>TbbFlow</code> can now log each node's entry, exit and possibly error action.
This measures what is seen at the <code>TbbFlow</code> node level and
implementations of <code>INode</code> need not change anything to participate.  The
resulting log can then be parsed to answer various questions.
</p>

<p>
One "cute" question is "what does the graph execution history look
like?".  One answer is in the form of an animation produced with some
help from <a href="https://github.com/mapio/GraphvizAnim">GraphvizAnim</a> and some code in <code>wire-cell-python</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org11a92e0">
$ wirecell-img anidfg mylog.txt
$ animate anidfg.gif
</pre>

<p>
The current styling leaves some things to be desired, but an example
animation follows.  Look for nodes to change from black to red which
indicates they are active during a sampled time slice.
</p>

<p>
Expect <code>wirecell-img</code> to learn to produce a timing summary in the near
future.
